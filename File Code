> #I used the edit data function to clean up my data and remove rows with too many missing observations
> #In addition the entering grade level column had to be cleaned and the kindergartens had to be swapped out for "K"
> #There was also a kinder observation in this column which also had to be changed to K
#I then used the data frame tools to reconfigure the names of the observations
#in addition i also utilized the ggplot tool to create a graph that demonstrated the relationship between the scores on the verbal test and the year that the person entered school

This was also very crucial in the Birth Month as many entries were not constistant and used the number or simply just incorrect spelling
Using the ifelse command was crucial in both removing and ignoring values that were not consistant or did not provide me with information
I used the summary command or head command often as well as it let me get either a full or partial look at my dataset so I know what i need to fix or edit
There was also many numerical observations that were messy or were a fraction of some sort that I cleaned up through R
