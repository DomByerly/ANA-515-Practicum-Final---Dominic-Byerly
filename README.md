# ANA-515-Practicum-Final---Dominic-Byerly

Attatched I have a multitude of items, including the R code I used, The comments I made on my R code, two seperate Line graphs that depict the interactions between variables
I also have uploaded the original dataset and my final edited dataset that I created Using R that i exported back to excel. 
I used many different codes and tools in cleaning my data and I think the evidence is clear that the second data set is increasingly more clean and is ready to have descriptive statistics done on it.
